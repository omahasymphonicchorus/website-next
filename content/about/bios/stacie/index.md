A versatile pianist, Stacie Haneline maintains an active recital career in symphonic, chamber, opera, vocal and instrumental repertoire. Thomas Wilkins (Music Director of the Omaha Symphony and Principal Conductor of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra) states, “…her musical excellence is overshadowed only by her generous spirit and kindness to her colleagues.” Stacie’s career highlights include performing with Boston Symphony’s Hawthorne Quartet in the world premiere of Clint Needham’s Voices for String Quartet and Orchestra; and the premiere of Leslie Adams’ Dunbar Songs with soprano Gail Robinson-Oturu. Haneline has served as a collaborative pianist for the Sydney Opera House, the University of Australia, New York City Opera, Kennedy Center, Hawaii Opera, Virginia Symphony, Virginia Opera, Brooklyn Academy of Music, Brevard Music Center, Omaha Symphony and Opera Omaha.
 
An established collaborator with Nebraska-based soprano, Jamie Reimer, Haneline and Reimer performed at the African American Arts Song Alliance featuring Robert Owens’ 4 Sonnets to Duse, and most recently, the duo has developed cutting-edge research on collaborative partnerships between singers and pianists, presenting their findings in Stockholm, Sweden and at the International Symposium on Performance Science in Reykjavik, Iceland. Stacie also frequently joins flutist Christine Beard, with whom she has performed at the National Flute Association Convention, at flute festivals in Ecuador, Honduras and France, and on numerous faculty recitals at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Stacie’s avid accomplishments as a chamber artist garnered her recognition as a semi-finalist for the coveted American Prize in chamber music as a member of I, the Siren 2015.
 
A passionate proponent of chamber music, Ms. Haneline’s arts administration experience extends throughout multiple organizations, including a 10-year position as Executive Director of the Omaha Chamber Music Society. For her efforts, Wilkins has again hailed Stacie, stating that, “her tireless efforts to keep chamber music alive in the city is a gift not only to my musicians, but to our entire community as well.” In her current role as Artistic Director for Vesper Concerts, she enjoys collaborating and programming many different musical and artistic genres, and is particularly drawn towards socially relevant projects.
 
A graduate of the Manhattan School of Music and Converse College, Haneline studied with Dr. Mark Silverman, Arkady Aronov and Dr. Douglas Weeks, as well as Josef Raieff and Marilyn Neeley. Stacie joined the piano faculty at the University of Nebraska at Omaha in 2010 where she serves as the collaborative pianist for visiting artists, faculty, and ensembles.
