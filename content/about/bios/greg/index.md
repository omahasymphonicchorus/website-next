Dr. Greg Zielke is the Performing Arts Director and Professor of Music at Tabor College, Hillsboro, Kansas.  He supervises a vibrant arts program housed in the Shari Flaming Center for the Arts and conducts a newly formed choir, Theater of Voices.

Previously, Dr. Zielke was Professor of Music and Director of the Music Program at Grace University in Omaha, Nebraska.  He began teaching at Grace University in 1991.  There he was conductor of the Grace Chorale, and the Chamber Singers.  In addition, he taught conducting, choral methods, church music, music theory, music history, and private voice.  Under his direction, Grace choirs performed across America and took numerous concert tours to Australia and Europe.  The latest tour to Europe came in 2017.  

They have also performed with Soli Deo Gloria Cantorum, the Clarion Chorale, the Omaha Municipal Orchestra, and the Omaha Symphony Chamber Orchestra.  Grace University choirs under Dr. Zielke’s direction have performed the Faure Requiem, Amahl and the Night Visitors, the Mozart Requiem, Mendelssohn’s Elijah, Vivaldi Gloria, the Rutter Gloria and Requiem, Mozart’s Mass in C “Coronation,” Requiem for the Living by Dan Forrest, and Messiah by Handel.

Together with daughter Mackenzie Dehmer, he developed a musical theatre program at Grace University.  The musicals became a signature part of the Grace story and helped produce a number of very passionate and dedicated performers.

Dr. Zielke has been Conductor and Artistic Director of the Omaha Symphonic Chorus since their 2002-03 concert season.  Christmas at the Cathedral is OSC’s signature event, now in its 21st edition.  Other recent performances include Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven), Requiem (Faure), Carmina Burana (Orff), Porgy and Bess: Concert version (Gershwin), the Dvorak Stabat mater, and the Poulence Gloria.

Dr. Zielke debuted at Carnegie Hall (New York City) in 2009 as conductor of a performance of Haydn’s “Te deum.”  He returned in 2016 to conduct Mass in C (Coronation) by Mozart.

As a church musician, he is blessed to have two served churches in Omaha: Community Bible and Westwood.  He has been involved in training and developing passionate worship leaders for Christ honoring music and worship.  He especially enjoys the opportunity to lead church music seminars and church choir festivals.

Dr. Zielke studied at Tabor College (Bachelor of Arts in Music Education), Wichita State University (Master of Music Education), and the University of Missouri – Kansas City Conservatory of Music (Doctor of Musical Arts in conducting).  His conducting teachers include Dr. Harrison Boughton and Dr. Eph Ehly. 

His wife Tamara is an elementary music specialist for Millard Public Schools (Nebraska).  His two daughters, Mackenzie and Mikaela, are musicians pursuing careers in singing, theatre and teaching.  He is grateful for two wonderful sons-in-law, and two terrific grandsons.  Other than a baton, his favorite thing to wave in his fly rod.
