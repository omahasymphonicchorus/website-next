Mr. Gardner’s music, ranging from choral to larger orchestral works, has been performed internationally at various festivals, competitions, and recitals by a variety of community and professional organizations to include the Boston Children’s Chorus, William Baker Festival Singers, Nebraska Wind Symphony, and numerous universities and community choruses. Recent years have brought exciting new venues such as the 2018 Bali International Choral Festival, new premieres such as Requiem – The Promise of Eternity, a 40-minute work for chorus and expanded chamber orchestra, new locations such as performances in Hong Kong, Denmark, and Australia, and new experiences such as the premiere of his first official work as part of the Omaha Symphonic Chorus artistic staff. Most recently, Mr. Gardner had the distinct honor of having his arrangement of "Loch Lomond" performed by the National Youth Choir of Scotland for the 20th Anniversary Celebration of the Scottish Parliament, attended not only by members of parliament, but also Her Majesty The Queen.

Mr. Gardner, currently the Composer-in-Residence for the Omaha Symphonic Chorus of Omaha, Nebraska, believes that the greatest innovation and challenge for the modern composer is not just the creation of something new, but of something unique, accessible, and enduring. As a result, his deeply introspective, beautifully melodic and moving compositional style appeals to a wide range of audiences and performers. He continues to explore original concepts of music composition including Story-Composing, the simultaneous composition of music and poetic narrative.  Additionally, he enjoys working with local poets and organizations to collaboratively create original works.  Whenever possible, Mr. Gardner rehearses and conducts performances of his music, providing compositional insight and interpretation from the composer’s point-of-view. His interests also include speaking with students and aspiring artists about self-publishing, music composition, and the confident pursuit of musical interests.

In addition to being a composer passionate about the benefits of self-publishing, Mr. Gardner is the director of Freedom Voices, an a cappella chamber choir dedicated to the service of military veterans and their families. He has remained active as a performer by singing in all the organizations with which he is associated, even venturing into new territory by learning to sing Barbershop. 

Mr. Gardner earned his undergraduate degree in music composition and theory from the University of Nebraska at Omaha. He studied composition primarily with Dr. W. Kenton Bales, and has performed extensively under the direction of Dr. Z. Randall Stroope, Dr. James Saker, and Dr. Cina Crisara.  He completed his Master of Science in Music Technology degree at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis, a unique program that leverages expertise from both the Indiana University Department of Music and the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology.

Whether inspiration for a melody or chord is found while walking in nature, looking up at the heavens, or spending time with his family, Mr. Gardner's music is a reflection of the joy found in all of these combined experiences.
